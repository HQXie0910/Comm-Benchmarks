The channel coding are implemented by the MATLAB. Before using the files, you should generate the bit streams by the files in the source coding. Two types of channel coding are proposed for text and images over MIMO channels

## Turbo coding

`text_turbo_MIMO.m` is to transmit the text information with Turbo coding

```shell
matlab text_turbo_MIMO.m
```

## LDPC Coding

`image_ldpc_MIMO.m` is to transmit the image with LDPC coding

```shell
matlab image_ldpc_MIMO.m
```
